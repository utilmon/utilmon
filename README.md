### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a physicist with experience modeling and simulating complex systems and phenomena for photoemission processes. In particular, I have worked on Partial Differential Equations such as the Boltzmann equation, Monte Carlo simulation, Density Functional Theory calculations, and machine learning. I hope to use my knowledge of Physics, Math, and numerical and computational methods in defining and developing new computational tools to aid research.

My skills include Python and C programming, using computing clusters. I have also used quantum computing libraries to solve various optimization and machine learning problems.
