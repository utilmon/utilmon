### Hi 👋

I'm a Cornell Ph.D. Physicist experienced in automating complex metrology workflows through custom computer vision solutions. Proven ability to architect end-to-end ML pipelines that handle high-volume data streams. Aiming to apply rigorous problem-solving skills to build reliable, scalable machine learning infrastructure

Highlights of my career:

- Developed a computer vision ML solution to classify wafer map failure patterns reducing reporting cycle time by over 80%
- Accelerated electron microscope imaging throughput by 10x+ by engineering a super-resolution ML model to reconstruct high-fidelity images for critical dimension metrology, significantly reducing data acquisition time.
- Developed an ML surrogate model for electron beam simulation, achieving a 1000x speedup over the traditional process with 98% accuracy.
- Author and maintain an open-source Python project (+100 stars) for the Interactive Brokers API, supporting stock and options trading.
- Developed and deployed live market-neutral crypto strategies leveraging CFTC Commitments of Traders (CoT) data to extract sentiment-based alpha, achieving a 2.1 Sharpe ratio over the last 7 months.
- Predicted unconventional correlation between electron beam properties and laser intensity used for photoemission using Monte Carlo methods and Boltzmann equations (+200 citations).
